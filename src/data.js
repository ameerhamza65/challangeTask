The 13 July assassination attempt on Trump is already being officially investigated, including by the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-service-agents-on-leave-trump-shooting/\">Secret Service</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/butler-investigation-updates\">the FBI</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/donald-trump-man-arrested-threat\">Man accused of threatening to kill Trump arrested in Arizona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kennedy, the scion of one of the country’s most famous Democratic political dynasties, got a roar of approval from Republicans when he joined Trump onstage at a Republican campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona. “Bobby! Bobby!” the crowd chanted.</p> <p>Kennedy had announced earlier on Friday that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/robert-f-kennedy-jr-drops-out-endorses-trump\">suspending his third-party campaign</a> for president and endorsing Trump. Kennedy’s vice-presidential pick, Nicole Shanahan, had previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/robert-f-kennedy-jr-drops-out-endorses-trump\">spoken out</a> about the campaign’s belief that staying in the race would result in a victory for Harris, because “we draw votes from Trump”. Kennedy said he would remove himself from the ballots in swing states, where he might siphon electoral college votes from Trump, while <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-map-on-the-ballot-states/\">staying on the ballot in other states</a>.</p> <p>In a brief speech at the rally, Kennedy said Trump would “make America healthy again” and that he would be a president “who is going to protect us against totalitarianism”.</p> <p>In praising Kennedy for his support, Trump referenced Kennedy’s father, a Democratic US senator and attorney general, and his uncle, a Democratic president. “I know they are looking down right now and they are very, very proud of Bobby. I’m proud of Bobby,” Trump said.</p> <p>Kerry Kennedy, one of RFK’s sisters, <a href=\"https://x.com/tylerpager/status/1827094446288097731\">told a Washington Post reporter</a> earlier in the day that her brother’s embrace of Trump was “obscene”, and said: “I think if he were alive today my father would have detested almost everything about Donald Trump.”</p> <p>Trump’s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, has recently been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/jd-vance-speech-extremist-far-right-book\">linked to a conservative group </a>that advocates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/jd-vance-speech-extremist-far-right-book\">repealing the 1964 Civil Rights Act</a>, an anti-discrimination law which was introduced by John F Kennedy and became law after his assassination.</p> <p>In a joint statement before the Glendale Trump rally, five of Kennedy’s siblings – Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Chris Kennedy and Rory Kennedy – called RFK’s endorsement of Trump “a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold” and “a sad ending to a sad story.” They said they were supporting the Democratic ticket of Harris and Walz.</p> <p>As temperatures exceeded 100F (38C) in Arizona, local news outlets<a href=\"https://x.com/abc15/status/1827113060449894874\"> reported</a> that <a href=\"https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/glendale/many-people-treated-for-heat-exhaustion-waiting-to-get-into-desert-diamond-arena-for-trump-rally?dafljgka\">more than 100 people</a> had been treated for heat exhaustion as they waited to get inside the Trump rally, with some getting medical treatment on site, and some being transported to a hospital.</p> <p>Kennedy joined Trump in Glendale less than 24 hours after Arizona’s secretary of state confirmed that Kennedy’s campaign had officially requested to be removed from ballots in Arizona.</p> <p>Election officials in <a href=\"https://x.com/AZSecretary/status/1826824488249688233\">Arizona</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/FrankLaRose/status/1827097088477557019\">Ohio</a> confirmed that Kennedy’s name will not be on the ballot in their states, and he is also listed as <a href=\"https://candidate.texas-election.com/Elections/getQualifiedCandidatesInfo.do\">withdrawn from the race</a> on the Texas secretary of state’s website. Kennedy’s campaign has also reportedly filed paperwork to remove his name from the ballot in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/read-rfk-jr-pennsylvania-court-filing/index.html\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>But in key battleground states of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, election officials said it was too late for Kennedy to take his name off the ballot even if he wants to do so.</p> <p>Trump’s suggestion that he would create a government panel of experts to work with Kennedy to investigate children’s health problems in the US is notable, given Kennedy’s track record.</p>    <p>In recent decades, Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, has become “among the most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines” and “has traveled the world spreading false information about the pandemic,” the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a\">Associated Press reported</a>.

The Associated Press has investigated the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a\">consequences of Kennedy’s advocacy </a>on individual families and “how Kennedy had capitalized on the pandemic to build [Children’s Health Defense, his advocacy group] into a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e\">multimillion-dollar misinformation engine</a>”.</p> <p>Kennedy has for years falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, and more recently he has made series of other lurid health claims, including that wifi <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/13/1187272781/rfk-jr-kennedy-conspiracy-theories-social-media-presidential-campaign\">causes “leaky brain”</a>, school shootings might be linked to antidepressants, and that chemicals in water <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/jun/28/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-evidence-atrazine-in-the-water-supply-is-causin/\">were making children transgender</a>.</p> <p>Some Kennedy supporters said they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-suspends-campaign-supporters\">found his endorsement of Trump frustrating</a>, because they had been drawn to RFK Jr as an alternative to the two-party system, and because some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-suspends-campaign-supporters\">were not willing to vote for Trump</a>.</p> <p>Kennedy, like Trump’s own vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, has previously savaged Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/23/dnc-kamala-harris-trump-rfk-campaign-election-updates?page=with:block-66c8fc678f0858e1c8699908#block-66c8fc678f0858e1c8699908\">publicly and privately</a>. He reportedly called Trump “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/robert-f-kennedy-trump\">probably a sociopath</a>”, “barely human” and “the worse [sic] president ever” in text messages, according to the New Yorker.</p> <p>In 2020, Kennedy <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robert-kennedy-jr-on-donald-trump-142603057.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADtgTS-tGG8BJhZX00_LiNuW9bX0lcvzOv4-5uHZumWS-w-kk9046lX_DiQ66JJKPOVXDBtvFP66Y27keaI3B7XQhHr4XnGP53GNVsqjQwqaBEYk3APARiPfhL78W-1COYy7fpq8zlKJNoeD-Chij3vaiIWFhv9CuAIts_sp9qnT&amp;guccounter=2\">publicly called</a> Trump a “bully” and said he had “discredited the American experiment with self-governance,” and more recently he called Trump’s criticism of him “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/28/robert-kennedy-jr-trump-rant\">unhinged</a>”.</p> <p>It went both ways: in May, Trump had attacked Kennedy in a social media post, Truth Social, calling Kennedy “junior” and labeling him “one of the most Liberal Lunatics ever to run for office”.</p> <p>Trump references their past differences at the Glendale rally, saying, “He also went after me a couple times. I didn’t like it.”</p> <p>Trump had praised Kennedy and said, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-drops-his-democratic-primary-bid-will-run-as-an-independent\">contrary to the available evidence</a>, that Kennedy would have defeated Joe Biden if he had stayed in the Democratic presidential primary, rather than deciding in October 2023 to launch an independent bid for the presidency.</p> <p><em>Sam T Levin and the Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

He is probably a sociopath.”</p></li> \n   <li><p>In April, after Trump accused Kennedy of being a “Democratic plant”, Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/28/robert-kennedy-jr-trump-rant\">posted</a>: “When frightened men take to social media they risk descending into vitriol, which makes them sound unhinged.

We walk away from that and we explain to our base why we’re making this decision.”</p> \n  <p>At the height of his campaign. Kennedy was polling at 10% of voters but since Biden dropped out from re-election in July and vice president Kamala Harris stepped in, Kennedy’s polling support halved.

                    "body": "<p>A striking feature of the age of billionaires in which we now live is that billionaires are more and more inclined to give us the benefit of their opinions. In the past year alone, we’ve had Marc Andreessen’s retro-futurist “Techno-optimist manifesto”, Mark Zuckerberg’s pronouncements on the future of media, and, most recently, a cosy chat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump (whose billionaire status is often touted but remains questionable). In most cases, the main effect has been to demonstrate that, however good they are at making money, billionaires are no smarter than the rest of us when it comes to politics or the ordinary business of life.</p> <p>Australia’s richest billionaire by far is Gina Rinehart, who has massively multiplied the already substantial fortune she inherited from her father, the late Lang Hancock (Rinehart claims she inherited <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/25/the-miners-daughter\">more debts than assets</a>). Like Hancock, who spent decades on the rightwing fringe of Australian politics, Rinehart has never been shy about expressing her opinions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/23/gina-rinehart-kennedy-awards-speech-ntwnfb\">Where’s the beef? Gina Rinehart puts past journalism quarrel aside with pies at the Kennedys | Weekly Beast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/23/gina-rinehart-news-corp-bush-summit-speech-townsville-ntwnfb\">those opinions</a> suggests that, taken as a whole, they would pass the “pub test”, in that they are about as sophisticated and intellectually consistent as you might expect to hear in the evening at a public bar. In common with many opinionators, Rinehart disdains the constraints of arithmetic, simultaneously demanding lower taxes, more public spending and lower deficits, all to be paid for by eliminating unspecified waste, fraud and duplication.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/bush-summit/bush-summit-2024-primary-industries-increasingly-under-attack-says-gina-rinehart/news-story/8d63c69cfa4c8a33b16b0946123acd39\">recent piece in the Daily Telegraph</a>, published as part of a News Corp “Bush summit” series, illustrates this point. Hancock begins with a familiar litany of woes about the high costs faced by farmers and the burden of (unspecified) red tape, forcing them off the land. This part of her article could have been (and has been) written any time in the past 50 years or more.</p> <p>No one reading this sad tale would be aware that farm incomes have been at <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-07/farm-sector-sets-90-billion-record-abares-reveals/102059398\">record highs last year</a>, an outcome reflected in strongly increased land prices. The executive director of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences,<em><strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-07/farm-sector-sets-90-billion-record-abares-reveals/102059398\">noted at the time</a>: “When you look at the cropping sector in particular, average farm incomes are about 75% above the 10-year average – about $665,000 – up slightly from last year.”</p> <p>Farming is a risky business and these outcomes depended in part on a string of good seasons that came to an end this year, with farm incomes <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/about/news/farm-incomes-fall-drier-conditions-lower-prices\">now back to where they were three years ago</a>. But a <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/agricultural-outlook/farm-performance-forecasts\">rebound seems likely</a>, making Rinehart’s gloomy pronouncements seem overstated, to say the least.</p> <p>Turning to remedies, Rinehart wants a string of tax reductions, including the abolition of payroll tax and stamp duties along with reductions in excise tax on fuel. A striking feature of this wishlist is that most of the benefits would go to city dwellers. Few farm businesses are large enough to reach the threshold for payroll tax. Family-owned farm businesses are exempt from stamp duty on intra-family transfers, while city dwellers routinely pay tens of thousands of dollars as a cost of moving house. Finally, no excise tax is paid for on-farm (or mining) use of fuel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/23/gina-rinehart-news-corp-bush-summit-speech-townsville-ntwnfb\">Gina Rinehart urges government to ‘drill, baby, drill’ and build Israeli-style ‘iron dome’ in northern Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These proposals aren’t matched by a willingness to accept reduced public services. After acknowledging the need for “nurses, police, hospitals, health care, our increasing numbers of elderly, emergency services and veterans (And much more)”, Rinehart goes on to demand a massive increase in provision of these services to rural areas, saying that “the Pilbara in Western Australia should have some of the best hospitals and infrastructure in the world, plus some of the best playgrounds and sports facilities”.</p> <p>Some areas of public expenditure didn’t make it on to her list, but Rinehart has covered many of them elsewhere. She has been a keen proponent of <a href=\"https://www.ginarinehart.com.au/des-houghton-katters-right-we-need-more-dams-more-mines-and-more-gas/\">publicly subsidised dams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/if-the-government-really-cared-billionaire-gina-rinehart-offers-labor-daring-advice-on-tackling-cost-of-living-housing-crisis/news-story/d5038ebf6ce57944964793e6aaafb021\">relaxing means tests on pensions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ginarinehart.com.au/why-gina-rinehart-wants-peter-dutton-to-get-a-bigger-budget/\">more spending on defence</a> (apparently to be financed by selling off the defence department’s “pot plants, paintings and sculptures”).</p> <p>The closest Rinehart comes to suggesting a cut in public expenditure is a nebulous reference to handouts of “another $500m here, another $500m there”, most of which is apparently spent within the Canberra bureaucracy. Doing away with these would supposedly cover the tens of billions of dollars of reduced revenue and higher spending implied by her lengthy wish list.</p> <p>And, of course, all of this is to be achieved while cutting debt and deficits, lest we <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10031933/Gina-Rinehart-warns-Australia-end-impoverished-like-Sri-Lanka-Argentina.html\">share the fate of Sri Lanka and Argentina</a>.</p> <p>There’s nothing particularly unusual about Rinehart’s grab-bag of opinions. You can hear similar thoughts in any public bar (or, with minor variations, any inner-city coffee shop). But as a contribution to discussion of public policy, they are best left there.</p>",

The challenge is considerable – Burke won the seat at the 2022 election with a margin of 15.2%.</p> \n<p>The next federal election, which is due by May 2025, has not yet been declared, but Watson is already shaping up as a defining contest.</p> \n<p>Basyouny says he has sensed excitement since his candidacy was announced. “The minute people realised there is another option and that their voices could be genuinely heard, there was always a sense of relief,” he says.</p> \n<p>Labor and Burke are “pathologically unambitious”, says Basyouny, who wants to show locals who have traditionally voted Labor that there is another way.</p> \n<p>“There has been a growing anger here at being ignored. And I tell people, I am going to be eating the government’s heart about a lack of spending here, about a lack of investment in Watson.”</p> \n<p>He adds: “There is a quiet revolution happening.”</p> \n<p>Burke and the Labor party are taking the independent challenge seriously. Labor remains confident the minister can withstand it, but party sources acknowledge there is “a narrow path” to victory for a challenger seeking to harness unhappiness in Watson over the government’s handling of the Gaza issue.</p> \n<p>They calculate that despite the negative sentiment, Burke’s longtime incumbency will be a significant advantage over Basyouny, who must now introduce himself to the electorate and has only months to do it.</p> \n<p>Burke has also secured public support from some higher profile western Sydney Muslim leaders and Labor hopes this will help too.</p> \n<p>More than 70% of the electorate’s constituents told the last census that both their parents were born overseas. There are more people with Lebanese and Chinese ancestry than people who identified as having Australian ancestry, and just over a quarter of residents identify as Muslim.</p> \n<h2>‘Tony has never let us down’</h2> \n<p>Dr Jamal Rifi has been advocating for the local community from his medical practice in Belmore for more than 20 years. He calls Burke a friend of the community and says the community shouldn’t “stab its friends in the back”.</p> \n<p>“He is a humanitarian, he is sincere, and he is very loved in this community. And Tony Burke is a powerful ally. He isn’t some backbencher or some independent who can’t change anything.”</p> \n<p>Rifi has already assembled Friends of Tony Burke, an ad-hoc group that will campaign on behalf of the MP. Rifi says he has printed more than 300 T-shirts and intends to build an “army”.</p> \n<p>“The friends of Burke army,” he says. “We will go to people’s houses, we will door knock and talk to people.</p> \n<p>“It’s a crucial time. And Tony has never let us down, so we won’t let him down.”</p> \n<p>The Lebanese Muslim Association, an influential organisation that manages the Lakemba Mosque, has a long history of political engagement but has declared they want to remain neutral at the next federal election.</p> \n<p>Gemal Khier, the association’s secretary, says the organisation will hold forums with the candidates, but it is not “our place to tell people how to vote”.</p> \n<p>“We believe it is our time to educate the community about being politically smart. We don’t want to tell people who to vote for, it’s not our role.”</p> \n<p>But Khier says the war in Gaza has mobilised people, especially the local Arab and Muslim communities, like never before.</p> \n<p>“This community has realised – and sadly it took Gaza for it to happen – that the only change that can happen is when we have a real political voice. And I’m not advocating for either Labor or Liberal or even independent. What I’m advocating for is our community,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Gaza is a prime concern that we have. Yes, there are other concerns locally, but we are living and the people of Gaza are not. And we want to give people space to advocate for Gaza at the next election.”</p> \n<p>Councillor Barbara Corey has been in politics for more than 30 years and is the only independent on the local Canterbury-Bankstown council. She says the area is ready for change.</p> \n<p>“There is an element of unrest here, despite the fact that Burke has been a pretty good member of parliament,” she says. “I think people want to see their representatives stand up for their constituency.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"903bc369-1336-4343-bb05-4d4f3f9b02b4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wit2XMT3IS0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Andy Marks, the executive director at the Centre for Western Sydney, says it will take a very “hyper-local” approach to destabilise Burke.</p> \n<p>“An independent candidate that’s able to drill down on those big issues like housing and cost of living, but at a very localised level may have appeal. Candidates that do that at the federal level and do it really effectively are having increasing success.</p> \n<p>“That is the secret sauce for an independent, where they are able to find those strong points of difference away from a national agenda.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/19/plestia-alaqad-journalist-poet-comment-dutton-gaza-security\">I fled Gaza to Australia not by choice but as a matter of survival.

He will destabilise the vote and make it difficult to predict, but it’s very hard to see Tony Burke losing that electorate.</p> \n<p>“But if Dr Basyouny differentiates himself enough from the major parties, if he broadens his support base beyond the Muslim community, and if he maintains focus on a very localised view, it will certainly be very competitive.”</p> \n<p>On the streets of Watson, views are mixed about whether Burke’s time is up.</p> \n<p>“I don’t really think he represents us or has done a good job,” says Margaritta Toumaras, who runs the popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/18/watany-manoushi-lebanese-bakeries-brisbane-feature-menu\">manoush</a> spot Belmore Lebanese Bakery.</p> \n<p>“Nothing gets fixed. You can’t even get parking here.</p> \n<p>“People are struggling here, especially with the cost of living. They don’t support families and could be doing much more.”</p> \n<p>But across the road at a barber adorned with basketball memorabilia, owner Adam Torcaso feels Burke’s longevity makes him more viable than any independent.</p> \n<p>“He’s just been there for such a long time, and that’s a pretty good sign right?” he says. “Otherwise, he would have gone a long time ago.</p> \n<p>“I think he is pretty fair and he brings people together here. If things are running smoothly, why change?”</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Karen Middleton</em></p>",

                    "body": "<p>Emily Wurramara had the world at her feet. The Indigenous singer-songwriter, then based in Brisbane, had recently released her debut album Milyakburra, named after her community on Bickerton Island in the Northern Territory. It had been received with warm reviews and escalating interest. Then, one night in 2019, her life came crashing down around her.</p> <p>She remembers she went to bed early, as she felt unwell. She was shaken awake by her brother, who was screaming. She opened her eyes and saw a painting made by her grandmother on the wall was burning. The unit was on fire.</p> <p>Wurramara grabbed her laptop and her daughter’s dummy. (Luckily, her daughter was staying elsewhere with her grandmother.) And they ran.</p>    <p>The blaze had started under her bedroom. It took <a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/the-faces-of-those-who-lost-everything-in-south-brisbane-blaze-20190503-p51joi.html\">11 fire-fighting crews several hours to bring it under control</a>. Wurramara and her family escaped with nothing but the clothes on their backs.</p> <p>Later, Wurramara says, she had an epiphany: “I had the people that loved me, my sister gave me the roof over her head, my daughter was safe, everyone was safe.”</p> <p>Wurramara’s new album is called Nara. In her native tongue of <a href=\"https://www.anindilyakwa.org.au/our-language/\">Anindilyakwa</a>, the word means “nothing”. Her mother tattooed the word on her right forearm; she rolls up her sleeve to show me. “It was when I realised that I had nothing, that I had everything.”</p> <p>We’re talking via Zoom. After the fire, Wurramara relocated to Dodges Ferry, 40 kilometres from Hobart in lutrawita/Tasmania. She’s rugged up in a Nasa hoodie, as far from Milyakburra and the heat of the Gulf as she can get, but her heart is full. “I’m physically cold, but spiritually and emotionally I’m feeling warm,” she says.</p> <p>Part of the satisfaction is romantic. “Well, I fell in love,” she says with a giggle, when asked for the reason behind the shift, but there was more to it than that. After the fire, Wurramara felt the need to start afresh. “I realised that in Meanjin [Brisbane], I couldn’t heal in a place that made me sick.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWxtzZFAMX4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWxtzZFAMX4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In Dodges Ferry, she is isolated and cold: “My first winter absolutely broke me.” It is, in every sense, a counterintuitive move for Wurramara, who is the definition of a people person: gregarious, enthusiastic, with a permanent, infectious smile. “I love yarnin’ and connecting with people, I’m very much a bubbly person.”</p> <p>She says she needed to move in order to grow, both as a musician and person: “I was way too comfortable with myself.” The proof is in Nara. Despite her self-imposed isolation, Nara is a confident and outgoing second album, this time written and sung almost entirely in English. Previously, Wurramara had often sung in Anindilyakwa.</p> <p>That, too, was a deliberate change. It wasn’t for commercial gain (Wurramara’s streaming numbers are already healthy enough), but to resist pigeonholing: “I wake up every day as a blak woman and nothing is going to change that, but that’s not my artistry; that’s me as a person. I should be able to explore my artistry without fitting into any boxes.”</p> <p>Wurramara was born in Darwin. Her family relocated to Brisbane when she was six. From her early childhood, she remembers going back and forth to Bickerton, west of Groote Eylandt in the western Gulf of Carpentaria. “The Dreaming stories, the moments I’d had on Bickerton had a pretty core role in my songwriting.”</p> <p>She remembers one in particular. “We were on a boat, and the waves were higher than the boat, but I just remember my pop and my nan being so calm. There was no stress, they knew the ocean wouldn’t hurt them, because it was their passage home and they were following the stars.”</p>    <p>A few days before our Zoom, she had bumped into Neil Murray, the songwriter behind <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vEntK3fwp8\">My Island Home</a>. “It’s an anthem to me. Whenever I hear it, I think about my grandparents, my aunties, all my families and my lineages. But I also think about mob and community, because home can be represented in different perspectives. Home, for me, is where my heart feels happy.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/14/i-felt-my-tongue-coming-alive-learning-a-critically-endangered-indigenous-language-is-a-small-triumph\">‘I felt my tongue coming alive’: learning a critically endangered Indigenous language is a small triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She is a saltwater woman; her most-streamed song (17m and counting) is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSoozjg9Fvk\">Lady Blue</a>, from Milyakburra. “I wrote it in literally a concrete jungle about missing home, and missing the ocean, and now all these people around the world … I got a video sent to me a couple of days ago of Lady Blue being played in this Japanese toy shop. I just think it’s so cool.”</p> <p>Why does she think it’s struck such a chord? “Everyone loves the ocean. She can be so beautifully chaotic sometimes, but it is a sacred place, and I think a lot of people connect with that and find her healing and special. Lady Blue takes you on a visual journey, you can picture it, you can smell it, you can feel the sand in your feet, flicking it up between your toes.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Nara is out now (ABC Music).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Emily Wurramara’s songs to live by</h2> <p>Each month, we ask our headline act to share the songs that have accompanied them through love, life, lust and death.</p> <p><strong>What was the best year for music, and what five songs prove it?</strong></p> <p>1996 baby!
